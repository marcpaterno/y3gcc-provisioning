This repository contains scripts and instructions for the installation
of the DES Y3 Galaxy Cluster Cosmology software.

The install-y3gcc.sh script should be executed, not sourced. Make
sure to read the top of the script, and to modify the value used
for Y3GCC_DIR to something appropriate for your use.

The scripts setup-y3gcc-cvmfs.sh and setup-y3gcc-macos.sh are to
be sourced, not executed. Again, make sure to read the top of the
script, and to modify the value of Y3GCC_DIR to match what you
used for the installation script.
